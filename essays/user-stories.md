As a developer, I want to easily be able to write high-level code for my game, so that I don't need to worry about the difficulty of writing low-level code.

As a modder, I want documentation of the engine and its features, so that I can easily create custom content for games.

As a distributor, I want the engine to have compatibility with multiple platforms, so that games can easily be installed and run for most people.

As a player, I expect stability from the engine, so that the games I play run smoothly and without bugs.
