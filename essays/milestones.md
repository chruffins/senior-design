# Major Milestones
- Picking a multimedia library (and possibly a script interpreter): this will likely determine what language I use for writing my game engine as well as require me to structure my backend about it.
- Designing my game engine: having a design for my game engine down will hopefully let me develop my game engine without any design-related technical debt.
- Developing my game engine: having a completed game engine is one of my deliverables for this project.
- Developing my videogame: the videogame will also be one of my deliverables as well as a proof of features of my videogame.

# Deliverables
- Game engine: this is the main product of my project
- Videogame: this is the other deliverable that'll show off the features of my game engine
