# Team Contract for Team Chrus
## Project Focus
A video game engine and a video game to demonstrate the former's features. The videogame would likely be in the JPRG genre, where players explore a number of settings to advance the story but the majority of the gameplay takes place in a constrained turn-based format. 

## Obligations
I, Chris Lee, am expected to design, document, and implement both the game engine and demo videogame.
