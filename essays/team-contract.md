# Team Contract for Team Chrus
***
## Obligations
***
I, Chris Lee, agree to create my own video game engine (and a video game to demonstrate its features). I will assign myself to work on the design and implementation of both the game engine and demo videogame. The scope of this video game engine will either cover 2D graphics or 3D graphics but not both. The demo will likely be in the JPRG genre, a type of roleplaying game where the player explores an overworld area but does combat in a constrained turn-based format.
