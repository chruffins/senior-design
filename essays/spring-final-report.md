## Project Description

Chrus Engine is a game engine intended for the development of lightweight, cross-platform, and performant 2D games. For this, Chrus Engine provides memory management, an audio engine, a rendering engine, serialization and deserialization of games, and a Lua scripting interface. The rendering engine includes support for bitmaps, animations, primitives, and shaders. Lastly, Chrus Engine is multithreaded, which enables drawing and logic to be processed in parallel.

## User Interface Specification

As the users of Chrus Engine are intended to be game developers, 

## [Test Plan and Results](./test-plan.md)
